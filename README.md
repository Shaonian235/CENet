# CENet:RGB-D Salient Object Detection via Cross-Modal Bidirectional Fusion and Edge-Aware Refinement
## Overiew
In this paper, we propose a salient object detection method for RGB-D image pairs, which achieves competitive performance across datasets containing various challenging scenarios. In addition to conducting experiments on classical datasets, we perform generalization experiments to test our method on RGB-T datasets.
